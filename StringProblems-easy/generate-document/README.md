# Generate Document...

- ## **_Category-Strings_**
- ### **_Difficulty-Easy_**

You're given a string of available characters and a string representing a document that you need to generate.
Write a function that determines if you can generate the documenet using the available characters. If you can generate the document, your function should return true; otherwise, it should return false.

## Sample Input

---

```
characters='Bste!dhetsi ogEAxpelrt x '
document='AlgoExpert is the Best!'

```

## Sample Output

---

```
true
```

## Approach to Solution

---

### Time Complexity

---

- The time complexity of this approach is O(n+m)- where m is the length of the document, and n is the number of characters.

### Space Complexity

---

- The space complexity of this approach is O(c)
  where c is the length of unique characters in the character string.
