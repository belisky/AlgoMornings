Given a non-empty string of lowercase letters and a non-negative integer representing a key, write a function that returns a new string obtained by shifting every letter in the input string by k positions in the alphabet, where k is the key.

Note that letters should 'wrap' around the alphabet; in other words, the letter z shifted by one returns the letter a.

## Sample Input

---

```
string='xyz'
key=2
```

## Sample Output

---

```
'zab'
```

## Approach to Solution

---

### Time Complexity

---

- The time complexity of this approach is O(n).

### Space Complexity

---

- The space complexity of this approach is O(n)
  where n is the length of string.
