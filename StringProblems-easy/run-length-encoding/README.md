# Run Length Encoding...

- ## **_Category-Strings_**
- ### **_Difficulty-Easy_**

Write a function that takes in a non-empty string and returns its run-length encoding.

NB: long runs(runs of 10 or more characters) should be encoded in s a split fashion; Hence '12A' should be encoded as '9A3A'.

## Sample Input

---

```
string='AAAAAAAAAAAAABBCCCCDD'

```

## Sample Output

---

```
'9A4A2B4C2D'
```

## Approach to Solution

---

### Time Complexity

---

- The time complexity of this approach is O(n).

### Space Complexity

---

- The space complexity of this approach is O(n)
  where n is the length of string.
