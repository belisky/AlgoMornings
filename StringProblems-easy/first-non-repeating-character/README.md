- ### **_Difficulty-Easy_**

Write a function that takes in a string of lowercase English-alphabet letters and returns the index of the string's first non-repeating character.

## Sample Input

---

```
string='abcdcaf'

```

## Sample Output

---

```
 1
```

## Approach to Solution

---

### Time Complexity

---

- The time complexity of this approach is O(n)- where n is the length of teh input string.

### Space Complexity

---

- The space complexity of this approach is O(1) because the input string only has lowercase English-alphabet letters; thus the hash table will never have more than 26 character frequencies.
