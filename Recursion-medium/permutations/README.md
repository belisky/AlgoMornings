# Permutations...

- ## **_Category-Recursion_**
- ### **_Difficulty-medium_**

Write a function that takes in an array of unique integers and returns an array of all permutations of those integers in no particular order.

If the input array is empty, the function should return and empty array.

## Sample Input

---

```
array=[1,2,3]
```

## Sample Output

---

```
[[1,2,3],[1,3,2],[2,1,3],[2,3,1],[3,1,2],[3,2,1]]
```

## Approach to Solution

---

### Time Complexity

---

- The time complexity of this approach is O(n\*n!) time.-where n is the length of the input array.

### Space Complexity

---

- The space complexity of this approach is O(n\*n!) space.

### One step at a time.
