# BlackJack Probability...

- ## **_Category-Recursion_**
- ### **_Difficulty-medium_**

Write a function that takes in a target value as well as a dealer's `startingHand` value and returns the probability that the dealer will bust(go over the `target` value before standing). The `target` value will always be a positive integer, and the `startingHand` value will always be a positive integer that's amaller tahn or equal to the `target` value.

Your solution should be rounded to 3 decimal places and to the nearest value.

## Sample Input

---

```
target=21
startingHand=15

```

## Sample Output

---

```
0.45
```

## Approach to Solution

---

### Time Complexity

---

- The time complexity of this approach is O(n\*n!) time.-where n is the length of the input array.

### Space Complexity

---

- The space complexity of this approach is O(n\*n!) space.

### One step at a time.
