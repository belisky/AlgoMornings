# Staircase Traversal...

- ## **_Category-Recursion_**
- ### **_Difficulty-medium_**

You're given two positive integers representing the height of a staircase and the maximum number of steps that you can advance up the staircase at a time. Write a function that returns the number of ways in which you can climb the staircase.

## Sample Input

---

```
height=4
maxSteps=2

```

## Sample Output

---

```
5
```

## Approach to Solution

---

### Time Complexity

---

- The time complexity of this approach is O(n\*2^n) time.-where n is the length of the input array.

### Space Complexity

---

- The space complexity of this approach is O(n\*2^n) space.

---

### One step at a time.
