You're given a two-dimensional array that represents a 9x9 partially filled Sudoku board. Write a function that returns the solved Sudoku board.
```
- - 3 | - 2 - | 6 - -
9 - - | 3 - 5 | - - 1
- - 1 | 8 - 6 | 4 - -
- - - - - - - - - - -
- - 8 | 1 - 2 | 9 - -
7 - - | - - - | - - 8
- - 6 | 7 - 8 | 2 - -
- - - - - - - - - - - 
- - 2 | 6 - 9 | 5 - -
8 - - | 2 - 3 | - - 9
- - 5 | - 1 - | 3 - -

```
The objective is to fill the grid such that each row, column and 3x3 grid contains the numbers 1-9 exactly once. In other words, no row may contain the same digit more than once, no column may contain the same digit more than once, and none of the 9 3x3 subgrids may contain the same digit more than once.
