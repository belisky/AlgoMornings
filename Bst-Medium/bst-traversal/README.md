# BST Traversal...

- ## **_Category-BST_**
- ### **_Difficulty-Medium_**

Write three functions that take in a BST and an empty array, traverse the BST, and add its nodes' values to the input array and return that array. The three functions should traverse the BST using the in-order,pre-order, and post-order tree-traversal techniques respectively.

- Preorder: nodes' value,nodes' left child, nodes' right child
- InOrder: nodes' left child, nodes' value, nodes' right child.
- PostOrder: nodes' left child, nodes' right child, nodes' value.

### Approach to Solution.

- I used a recursive approach to this solution.

### Time Complexity

---

- The time complexity of this approach is O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the BST.

### Space Complexity

---

- The space complexity of this approach is O(n)- where n is the number of nodes in the BST.

### One step at a time.
