# Validate BST...

- ## **_Category-BST_**
- ### **_Difficulty-Medium_**

Write a function that takes in a potentially invalid Binary Search Tree and returns a boolean representing whether the BST is valid.

A node is said to be valid BST if its value is strictly greater than the values of every node to its left; its value is less than or equal to the values of every node to its right; and its children nodes are either valid BST nodes themselves or Null.

A BST is valid if and only if all of its nodes are valid BST nodes.

### Time Complexity

---

-The time complexity of this approach is O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the BST.

### Space Complexity

---

-The space complexity of this approach is O(d)- where d is the depth(height) of the BST.

### One step at a time.
