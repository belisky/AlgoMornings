- ### **_Difficulty-Medium_**

Write a BST class for a Binary Search Tree. The class should support:

- Inserting values with the insert method.
- Removing values with the remove method; this method should only remove the first instance of a given value.
- Searching for values with the contains method

### Time Complexity

---

-The time complexity of this approach is O(log(n)).

### Space Complexity

---

-The space complexity of this approach is O(1)

### One step at a time.
