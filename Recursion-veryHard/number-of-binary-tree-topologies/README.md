# Number Of Binary Tree Topologies...

- ## **_Category-Recursion_**
- ### **_Difficulty-veryHard_**
  
Write a function that takes in a non-negative integer `n` and returns the number of possible Binary Tree topologies that can be created with exactly n nodes.

A Binary Tree topology is defined as any Binary Tree configuration, irrespective of node values. For instance, there exist onlly two Binary Tree topologies when n is equal to 2: a root node with a left node, and a root node with a right node.

Note that when n is equal to 0, there's one topology that can be created: None.

 
## Sample Input

---

```
n=3

```

## Sample Output

---

```
5

```

## Approach to Solution

---

### Time Complexity

---

- The time complexity of this approach is O(n^2) time.

### Space Complexity

---

- The space complexity of this approach is O(n) space.
