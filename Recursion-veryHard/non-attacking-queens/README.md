- ### **_Difficulty-veryHard_**
  
Write a function that takes in a positive integer `n` and returns the number of non-attacking placements of `n` queens on an `nxn` chessboard.

A non-attacking placement is one where no queen can attack another queen in a single turn. In other words, it's a placement where no queen can move to the same position as another queen in a single turn.

In chess, queens can move any number of squares horizontally,vertically, or diagonally in a single turn.
