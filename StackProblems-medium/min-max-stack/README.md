# minMax Stack Construction...

- ## **_Category-Stacks_**
- ### **_Difficulty-medium_**

Write a MinMaxStack class for a Min Max Stack. The class should support:

- Pushing and popping values on and off the stack.
- Peeking at the value at the top of the stack.
- Getting both the minimum and the maximum values in the stack at any given point in time.

NB: All methods should run in constant time and space independently.

## Sample Input

## Approach to Solution

---

### Time Complexity

---

- The time complexity of this approach is O(1) time.

### Space Complexity

---

- The space complexity of this approach is O(1) space.

---

### One step at a time.
