# Colliding Asteroids...

- ## **_Category-Stacks_**
- ### **_Difficulty-medium_**

You're given an array of integers `asteroids`, where each integer represents the size of an asteroid. The sign of the integer represents the direction the asteroids is moving(positive=right, negative=left). All asteroids move at the same speed, meaning that two asteroids moving in the same direction can never collide.
