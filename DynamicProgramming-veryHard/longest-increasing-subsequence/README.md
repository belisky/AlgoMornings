# Longest Increasing Subsequence...

- ## **_Category-Dynamic Programming_**
- ### **_Difficulty-veryHard_**

Given a non-empty array of integers, write a function that returns the longest strictly-increasing subsequence in the array.

A subsequence of an array is a set of numbers that aren't necessarily adjacent in the array but that are in the same order as they appear in the array.

## Sample Input

---

```
 array=[5,7,-24,12,10,2,3,12,5,6,35]

```

## Sample Output

---

```
 [-24,2,3,5,6,35]
```

## Approach to Solution

---

### Time Complexity

---

- The time complexity of this approach is O(nlogn)- where n is the length of the array.

### Space Complexity

---

- The space complexity of this approach is O(n)

### One step at a time.
