# Palindrome Partitioning Minimum cuts...

Given a non-empty string, write a function that returns the minimum number of cuts needed to perform on the string uch that eah remaining substring is a palindrome.

A palindrome is defined as a string that's written the same forward as backward.

## Sample Input

---

```
string="noonabbad"

```

## Sample Output

---

```
 2 // noon|abba|d
```

## Approach to Solution

---

### Time Complexity

---

- The time complexity of this approach is O(n\^3)- where n is the length of the string.

### Space Complexity

---

- The space complexity of this approach is O(n\^2)

### One step at a time.
