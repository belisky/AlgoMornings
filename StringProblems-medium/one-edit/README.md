# One Edit...

- ## **_Category-Strings_**
- ### **_Difficulty-Medium_**

You're given two strings `stringOne` and `stringTwo`. Write a function that determines if these two strings can be made equal using only one edit.

## Sample Input

---

```
stringOne='devops'
stringTwo='dovops'

```

## Sample Output

---

```
True
```

## Approach to Solution

---

### Time Complexity

---

- The time complexity of this approach is O(n)- where n is the length of the shorter string.

### Space Complexity

---

- The space complexity of this approach is O(1) space.
