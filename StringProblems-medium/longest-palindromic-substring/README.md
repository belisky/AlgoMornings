# Longest Palindromic Substring...

- ## **_Category-Strings_**
- ### **_Difficulty-Medium_**

Write a function that, given a string, returns its longest palindromic substring.

A palindrome is defined as a string that's written the same forward and backward. Note that single-character strings are palindromes.

## Sample Input

---

```
string='abaxyzzyxf'

```

## Sample Output

---

```
'xyzzyx'
```

## Approach to Solution

---

### Time Complexity

---

- The time complexity of this approach is O(n^2) - where n is the length of the input string.

### Space Complexity

---

- The space complexity of this approach is O(n) - where n is the length of the input string.
