# Minimum Character for Words...

- ## **_Category-Strings_**
- ### **_Difficulty-Medium_**

Write a function that takes in an array of words and returns the smallest array of characters needed to form all of the words. The characters don't need to be in any particular order.

## Sample Input

---

```
words=['this','that','did','deed','them!','a']

```

## Sample Output

---

```
[t,t,h,i,s,a,d,d,e,e,m,!]
```

## Approach to Solution

---

### Time Complexity

---

- The time complexity of this approach is O(n*l) time- where l is the length of the longest word and n is the number of words.

### Space Complexity

---

- The space complexity of this approach is O(c) space.-where c is the number of unique characters across all words.
