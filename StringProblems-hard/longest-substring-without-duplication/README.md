- ### **_Difficulty-Hard_**

Write a function that takes in a string and returns its longessst substring without duplicate characters.

## Sample Input

---

```
string='nobelisyourdevopsengineer'
```

## Sample Output

---

```
belisyourd
```

## Approach to Solution

---

### Time Complexity

---

- The time complexity of this approach is O(n)- where n is the length of the shorter string.

### Space Complexity

---

- The space complexity of this approach is O(1) space.
