# Underscorify Substring...

- ## **_Category-Strings_**
- ### **_Difficulty-Hard_**

Write a function that takes in two strings: a main string and a potential substring of the main string. The function shold return a aversion of the main string with every instance of the subtring wrapped between underscores.

## Sample Input

---

```
string='testthis is a testtest to see if testestest it works'

substring='test'
```

## Sample Output

---

```
 '_test_this is a _testtest_ to see if _testestest_ it works'
```

## Approach to Solution

---

### Time Complexity

---

- The time complexity of this approach is O(n)- where n is the length of the shorter string.

### Space Complexity

---

- The space complexity of this approach is O(n) space.
