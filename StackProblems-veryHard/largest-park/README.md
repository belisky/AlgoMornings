# Largest Park...

- ## **_Category-Stacks_**
- ### **_Difficulty-veryHard_**

A city wants to build a new public park, and you've been tasked with finding the largest park they can build without disturbing existing infrastructure.

Write a function that takes in an two dimensional array `land` representing the total land mass of the city from top-down view. Return the area of the largest possible park.

## Sample Input

---

```
land=[
    [false,true,true,true,false],
    [false,false,false,true,false],
    [false,false,false,false,false],
    [false,true,true,true,true]
]
```

## Sample Output

---

```
6
```

## Approach to Solution

---

### Time Complexity

---

- The time complexity of this approach is O(w\*h) time- where w is the width of the input matrix and h is the height of the input matrix.

### Space Complexity

---

- The space complexity of this approach is O(w) space.

### One step at a time.
