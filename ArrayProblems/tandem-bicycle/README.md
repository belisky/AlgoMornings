# Tandem Bicycle..

- ## **_Category-Arrays_**
- ### **_Difficulty-Easy_**

A tandem bicycle is a bicycle that's operated by two people but the person that pedals faster dictates the speed of the bicycle.

- You're given two lists of positive integers: one that contains the speeds of riders wearing red shirts and on that contains the speeds of riders wearing blue shirts.

- Write a function that returns the maximum possible total speed or the minimum possible total speed of all tadem bicycles based on an input param, _fastest_. if _fastest=true_, your function should return the maximum possible total speed; otherwise it should return the minimum total speed.

## Sample Input

---

redShirtHeights=[5,5,3,9,2]
blueShirtHeights=[3,6,7,2,1]
fastest=true

## Sample Output

---

32

## Approach to Solution

---

### Time Complexity

---

- The time complexity of this approach is O(nlog(n))-- where n is equivalent to the length of either of the input arrays.

### Space Complexity

---

- The space complexity of this approach is O(1).-
